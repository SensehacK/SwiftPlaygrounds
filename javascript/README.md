# Sensehack Javascript

## Intro

This is just personal workspace for testing different functions related to javascript language.

I love to track my progress & git allows you to work around the problem statement by versioning it. So thats my inspiration for amalgamation of all of my other small code repository to a specific one stop solution repo for my local environment scratch pad.

## Content

Development Hell and most of JS quirks used with bit of documentation with small readme files along with my own documentation links of another repo I actively maintain for my own software developer growth.

Content would include :

- Plain Vanilla Javascript
- Angular Framework
- Ionic Framework
- Future plans -> May add React Repo in this too.

## Projects

Currently nothing is hosted as of now.
