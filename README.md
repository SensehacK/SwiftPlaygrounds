# Sensehack Playground

## Intro

This is just personal workspace for testing different functions related to Swift language.

I love to track my progress & git allows you to work around the problem statement by versioning it. So thats my inspiration for amalgamation of all of my other small code repository to a specific one stop solution repo for my local environment scratch pad.

## Content

Development Hell and most of Swift, Ionic quirks used with bit of documentation with small readme files along with my own documentation links of another repo I actively maintain for my own software developer growth.

Content would include :

- Language Basics
- Language different Frameworks
- Language Tests

- Future plans -> - React Playground

## Projects

Currently nothing is hosted to preview you would have to manually clone/download the project and build using respective instructions.

## Build

Clone the code and use the respective build instructions for specific folders to build the codebase.
