# Python Repo

This repository consist most of my python coding experience at Infosys Foundation program. As much I love python, I just find it a bit slow and its indentation approach leaves much to desire. If I have to choose between Python, Java, Swift and Typescript. I‚Äôll probably ditch python first.




One of the folder consists of the  final exam project submission.
‚ÄúPyFood System‚Äù

The other folders are just structured accordingly with exercise files daily provided by Infosys.
